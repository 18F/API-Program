## Why Use This Program 
Even with guidance and support, a willing agency still takes about two years to launch an API program.  

## What This Offers Your Agency
* Jumpstart an agency API program 
* Begin to dogfood their own APIs 
* Understand and base decisions off of API analytics  
  
## Who Should Use This Program 

Small, medium, and large agencies, as well as medium and large individual teams within agencies would be fit candidates.  Even among agencies with first or second generation API programs already in existence, the capacity has often not been scaled out to be a ready resource for all teams.  The API Program provides such an easily launched capacity that multiple teams within one agency could legitimately want to onboard their own instance to maximize convenience and customization.
