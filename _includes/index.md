## Who Should Use This Program 

Of the approximately 280 federal agencies, roughly 100 have launched a public API program.   We know which these are and the maturity of their program.  Of the remainder, most are aware of the current or future need to move in this direction.  But whether an agency is serious in their interest or just flippantly curious, this program offers a quick means of leapfrogging directly to a third generation API program.  

Small, medium, and large agencies, as well as medium and large individual teams within agencies would be fit candidates.  Even among agencies with first or second generation API programs already in existence, the capacity has often not been scaled out to be a ready resource for all teams.  The API Program provides such an easily launched capacity that multiple teams within one agency could legitimately want to onboard their own instance to maximize convenience and customization.
