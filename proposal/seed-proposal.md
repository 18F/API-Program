## In one sentence, what is the problem are you trying to solve?

Even with guidance and support, a willing agency still takes about two years to launch an API program.  

## Tell us more about the problem. (If you'd like to provide more context.)

Over the past three years, we have engaged with over 80 agencies who have launched API programs and almost as many who haven't but realize that they need to.  We have a clear vision for how agencies crawl, then walk, then run.  

The current “/Developer Program” offers agencies all of the consultation and support that they need to build and grow an API program on their own but the one thing we haven’t offered at scale is the API itself.  We can help an agency understand APIs, plan for them, and employ them once they are live.  But our ability to actually stand up the API with the agency has been limited since we have thus far focused on building advanced, bespoke APIs (e.g., discovery.gsa.gov, OpenFEC).  We are building Porsches and rightly so.  But this does not scale.  At best, we can do 4-5 such projects at a time and they take significant time and effort.  

In the meantime, there are scores of eager agencies who are eager to get started but struggle to do so.  

As we often tell agencies, the third API they build will be much easier than the second; the fourth will be easier than the third.  Sure enough, we have seen time and again that it is the first API that is the hardest for an agency to stand up.  The same inertia that helps a program that is up and running also keeps the agency at rest all the likelier to stay still.  The reasons are foreseeable and largely ephemeral but they are real nonetheless:  uncertainty about a new frontier, expensive internal estimates, and IT shops with other priorities.  

## Explain your proposed solution to this problem.

For the first time ever, a complete API program available at scale from GSA.  

Right now, we offer agencies two scalable services that assist agencies in their API efforts: the resources and consultations of the /Developer Program and the shared services of api.data.gov.  Both are popular and useful but lack the one single solution most agencies struggle with: standing up the actual functionality to host APIs. But combined, the three would include everything an agency needs to launch a first and even second generation API program and at a fraction of the time and price of virtually any other means.  

We now have the ability to stand up a blank slate web service at https://api.agency.gov, hosted inexpensively in the cloud, easily maintained, and meeting federal standards of security and scale.  By using a pilot to assemble the recipe, subsequent iterations could be offered with negligible developer resources.  Once a solid API stack is settled upon, GSA could clone new instances within the agency’s domain and use the resources of the /Developer Program to help the agency take ownership and drive forward.  

Like a transplanted organ, the API program would simply require the agency accept it and allow us to help them begin using their new capability.  We already have the guidance and resources an agency would need to go from there, but many will gladly procure further consultation to advise their efforts and amplify their developer engagements.   


## Who is your target customer?

Of the approximately 280 federal agencies, roughly 100 have launched a public API program.   We know which these are and the maturity of their program.  Of the remainder, most are aware of the current or future need to move in this direction.  But whether an agency is serious in their interest or just flippantly curious, this program offers a quick means of leapfrogging directly to a third generation API program.  

Small, medium, and large agencies, as well as medium and large individual teams within agencies would be fit candidates.  Even among agencies with first or second generation API programs already in existence, the capacity has often not been scaled out to be a ready resource for all teams.  The API Program provides such an easily launched capacity that multiple teams within one agency could legitimately want to onboard their own instance to maximize convenience and customization.   

## Does something like this already exist? If so, explain the need for this new project.

Two projects partially overlap this program’s offerings: Socrata’s API Foundry and the Inventory.Data.gov project.  In both cases, an agency could avail itself of these engines to host a simple API. Both though are borrowed resources, with other priorities and significant limitations for the mission this program addresses.  

Socrata’s service is an expensive and limited capability that only lasts as long as the agency maintains its contract with the company.  Vendor lock-in keeps the agency from growing out the program except through an ever-growing contract.  

Most might miss the API capability of Inventory.Data.gov.  This is because the API functionality is tertiary to the primary functions of the underlying CKAN engine: cataloging and, sometimes, hosting data.  CKAN is not intended as an API engine - there is a reason that it is not known as one.  This isn’t an aspersion - it is rightly seen as the premiere data catalog solution but it is not offered to agencies as an enterprise API solution.  

Most of all, though, the API Program alone delivers a complete package, the holistic response to what we now know are common missing ingredients.  Not just the API hosting function, but also the rich developer documentation, developer engagement, guidance and hands-on direct support of the /Developer Program.  

## What are the anticipated outcomes? How do you plan to measure success/failure of this effort?

If brought to market at scale, this project would undercut any agency’s justifications for not having an API program.  Even for agencies that then still pursue other paths, there will be significant benefit to clearing the foggy confusion that enables so much inaction even to this day.  If an agency comes to realize that they could have the API program that they’ve been told is the part of their future needs by just saying yes to this offering, it will feel compelled to sooner reckon with this knock of modernity.  

The success of the pilot would be measured by the happiness of the two pilot agencies and the creation of a reproducible model that is ready to be indefinitely scaled out and served by GSA.  

The long-term metrics for success is the number of API programs successfully transplanted into agencies and their adoption in the aftermath.  The number of agencies that fully adopt and build out the resulting developer engagement will represent the degree to which the battleship that is government is turned towards the future.  

## What is your cost estimate for this project? Please explain costs.

The pilot phase would seek to build and deliver the API Program to two agencies gratis in such a way as to establish a repeatable process, such that then could be offered to any number of agencies at cost quickly and with only a fraction of the developer hours needed for the project.  

The pilot could be accomplished in four months for a cost of $79,296.  The costs are primarily billable hours - only $4,000 are needed for infrastructure.  The labor estimates are as follows:  

* Two GS-13s for 25% time (320 hours - $39,680)
* One GS-14 for 25% for 2 months and 10% for 2 months (112 hours - $19,264)
* One GS-15 for 25% for 2 months and 10% for 2 months (112 hours - $16,352)

## Would you like to share any additional information about your proposal?

Beginning with the May 2012 release of the Digital Government Strategy, GSA has offered other agencies general API support.  It has been productive but the size and lack of momentum in government has made progress linear.  APIs are the underpinnings to where tech has come and where it is going.  But government is not changing quickly enough.  The pace of new agency API programs is far too little and the top tier APIs delivered by 18F are of a quality that cannot be rushed.  Whilst 18F can and should still build the API equivalents of Porsches, we also need a concurrent means by which all of the other agencies can get their hands on a Camry.  

I estimate that a typical agency would advance its API efforts by 12-24 months with comparatively little effort.  This would result in significant cost-savings but more importantly negates the damage that is done each day that an agency is absent from the new playing field - the mindshare of the developer community.  

Furthermore, the API program would provide a very real line of business that agencies need, offering a significant role for GSA manpower to engage the rest of government in a lightweight and beneficent manner.  With this program, we can actually usher in the next generation of government APIs in a fraction of the time it would occur in otherwise.
