**Project Name**: API Program
**Project Lead**: Gray Brooks
**Project URL**: [https://18f.github.io/api-program](https://18f.github.io/api-program )

**Statement of the Problem**:  Despite clear evidence of need, only half of federal agencies have launched an API program and the majority of those that have lack basic components.  Agencies are aware that this needs to change, but even teams that are willing face traditional obstacles that result in timelines of 18-24 months to launch even an immature 1st generation API program.  

**Proposed Approach**: This solution proposes to - 

1. Develop a hardy, easily clonable API stack that 18F can instantiate and certify with very little effort.  
2. Integrate it with the existing offerings of the /Developer Program and api.data.gov.  
3. Offer it to agencies as their first opportunity for a comprehensive 2nd generation API program.  
4. For agencies that desire it, continue to provide direct consultation support as they iterate and grow out their API program.   

**Outcomes and Metrics**: The key metrics for this project are - 

* Number of agencies using service 
* Number of APIs produced as a result 
* Number of API keys requested as a result
* Number of API hits as a result 

**Biggest Risks to the Project and Mitigation Strategy**: The biggest risk is growing the program too quickly.  There is significant interest from agencies, so business development is not a concern.  What is most needed is to manage the growth of the program to always ensure the standards of consistency, reliability, and strength that agencies expect from 18F projects.  The best path to mitigate this risk is to hold to the pilot project’s design requirements and to ensure a billable line of business that can scale to support client agencies.  

**Progress to Date**:  Two thirds of the program already exists as active, well-utilized projects.  The principle need is in assembling the API stack itself.  I’ve conducted five developer interviews to help assemble the initial requirements and line up interested 18F developers.  One teammate is already on track to assemble a prototype API stack in the month of April and two others have expressed interest in assembling prototypes in May.  The project microsite is coming together at https://18f.github.io/api-program and should be ready for initial client feedback within weeks.  

**Cost Overview (to reach MVP)**: The pilot could be accomplished in four months for a cost of $79,296.  The costs are primarily billable hours - only $4,000 are needed for infrastructure.
