This program is designed to stand up an API capability for your agency as quickly as possible to better enable us to train your team and others at your agency. As a result, we are able to spend the bulk of our time and energy helping you to implement your API program and internalize the knowledge your agency needs to be fully self-sufficient in this area.  

There are four main areas of training in this engagement:  

* Training your team to create, maintain, and update your APIs.  
* Increasingly complex API design and developer engagement.  
* Basic 'Intro to APIs' courses for other staff memebers. 
* Executive API trainings.  

For more details on the training options, see the [agency manual](https://pages.18f.gov/api-program/agency-manual).
