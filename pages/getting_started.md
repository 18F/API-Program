## An API Program in Three Easy Steps
Don't be put off by jargon and machine language. Simply put, APIs are a way to surface the data you're already creating and to make it accessible to new audiences. 
[link to/steal some good text from existing API repos].

You can stand up an API program in three easy steps, either by using 18F's program on your own or by working with us.

1. Discover
2. Publish
3. Engage

## Discover
What data do you have? What data are people looking for when they visit your website? You'll get the most traction by starting with something that people already want.

## Publish
Publishing an API can be as simple as creating a .csv file.

## Engage
Tell the world. [User testing](http://18f.github.io/API-Usability-Testing/), [meetups](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Web-API-User-Group/), [listservs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/us-government-apis), and forums are great ways to get the word out about your API program and to work with the developer community.
