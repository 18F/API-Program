### Setting up the Engagement

1. The interested agency [emails the 18F intake team](Inquiries18F@gsa.gov) expressing interest in the API Program.  
2. The 18F intake team will confirm that we have current capacity for the project and that the API Program is a good fit for the interested agency.  
3. The interested agency should review the [Interagency Agreement text](https://pages.18f.gov/api-program/iaa/) and confirm the availability of budget.   
4. When the interested agency is ready, 18F will coordinate the signing of the agreement.  
5. The API Program team will schedule a kick-off meeting and bi-monthly meetings.
