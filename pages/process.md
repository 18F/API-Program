### Setting up the Engagement

1. The interested agency [emails the 18F intake team](Inquiries18F@gsa.gov) expressing interest in the API Program.  
2. The 18F intake team will confirm that we have current capacity for the project and that the API Program is a good fit for the interested agency.  
3. The interested agency should review the [Interagency Agreement text](https://pages.18f.gov/api-program/iaa/) and confirm the availability of budget.   
4. When the interested agency is ready, 18F will coordinate the signing of the agreement.  
5. The API Program team will schedule a kick-off meeting and bi-monthly meetings.  

### Technical Setup

6. 18F and Agency need to decide on the URL for the developer hub and the API endpoint.  
7. 18F sets up a vanilla developer hub, api.data.gov, and an AutoAPI instance.  
8. Agency coordinates the delegation of of the subdomains needed for the developer hub and the API endpoint.  
9. 18F completes the setup process with the new domains and gives the agency access to all properties.
