The hosted API uses the [api.data.gov service](https://api.data.gov/about) to provide several important functions:  
  
* API keys, to know who your developers are
* Usage tiers, to manage how they use your APIs
* API analytics, so that you can see who is using your APIs, how, and how much
  
For more details on how the API analytics work, see the [agency manual](https://pages.18f.gov/api-program/agency-manual).
