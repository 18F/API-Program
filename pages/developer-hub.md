A developer hub is the central resource that you put forward for developers who want to access your agency APIs.  It may include any of a [range of components](https://pages.18f.gov/API-All-the-X/pages/developer_hub_kit/), but most importantly must be a starting point where the developer can find your APIs and easily begin using them.  

The developer hub is located at a subsection of your website, preferably at `https://developer.agency.gov`, but should also be redirected from `agency.gov/developer` and `agency.gov/developers`.  It's major sections will include:   

* Overview of your available APIs  
* Individual API documentation  
* API key signup  
* Developer feedback   
* Program updates  
* Links to other Agency data and open source resources

Ideally, we will provide you with a discrete, easy to maintain Jekyll website [similar to these](https://pages.18f.gov/API-All-the-X/pages/open_source_documentation/).  However, the components can also be provided as materials that can be pasted into your existing CMS solution.  

For more details on the developer hub, see the [agency manual](https://pages.18f.gov/api-program/agency-manual).
